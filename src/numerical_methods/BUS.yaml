method_name: "BUS (Bayesian Updating with Structural Reliability Methods)"

description: |
  BUS combines Bayesian inference with structural-reliability sampling
  (Subset Simulation) to calibrate material parameters and quantify
  their uncertainty.  It constructs an artificial “failure event” in an
  augmented probability space, then successively samples conditional
  levels until the posterior distribution of the parameters is reached.
  
  • Produces a full posterior PDF for every parameter, not just a
    single best-fit value.  
  • Naturally provides credibility intervals and correlation
    information between parameters.  
  • More efficient than plain MCMC for high-dimensional or multi-modal
    posteriors because Subset Simulation explores low-probability
    regions in stages.  
  • Requires a forward model call at every sample, so computational
    cost still scales with the number of samples.
    
  Key algorithm steps:
    1. Choose priors for each parameter.  
    2. Define a likelihood based on the experimental–model discrepancy
       (e.g. Gaussian with standard deviation σ).  
    3. Embed the likelihood in a “limit-state” function  
         g(θ, u) = u − L(θ)  
       where u is a uniform random variable.  
    4. Use Subset Simulation to drive g ≤ 0 until the target conditional
       level equals the posterior.  
    5. Collect all surviving θ-samples as draws from the posterior.
    
  Fixed error metric:
    – Bayesian likelihood (usually Gaussian) with user-specified σ.
    
  Required UI inputs:
    – prior type and bounds for each parameter  
    – assumed σ (experimental noise)  
    – number of samples per BUS level  
    – target conditional probability per level (e.g. p₀ = 0.1)
